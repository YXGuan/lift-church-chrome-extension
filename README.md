## Whaaat?!

A Chrome extension that displays a LIFT daily devo quote every time a new tab is opened and provides you with a fun interactive background to play with!

## Development

* Run `npm i`
* To change the JavaScript, make changes to `.js` files in `src/js` (`ES6` recommended). 
* Run `npm run build` to transpile `ES6` into browser compatible `JS`.
